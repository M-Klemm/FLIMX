# Violin Plots for Matlab

A violin plot is an easy to read substitute for a box plot that
replaces the box shape with a kernel density estimate of the data, and
optionally overlays the data points itself. The original boxplot shape
is still included as a grey box/line in the center of the violin.

Violin plots are a superset of box plots, and give a much richer
understanding of the data distribution, while not taking more space.
You will be able to instantly spot too-sparse data, or multi-modal
distributions, which could go unnoticed in boxplots.

`violinplot` is meant as a direct substitute for `boxplot` (excluding
named arguments). Additional constructor parameters include the width
of the plot, the bandwidth of the kernel density estimation, and the
X-axis position of the violin plot.
