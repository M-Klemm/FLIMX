# MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> Color Tools

MATLAB Color Tools is an experimental collection of MATLAB functions related
to color science computation, color scales, visualization, and ICC color profiles.
It is meant to supplement the capabilities of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
and [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html)<sup>&trade;</sup>.

Some of the functions, along with explanations of the relevant theory, appear in the book [_Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB_](http://imageprocessingplace.com), 3rd edition, by Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, and Steven L. Eddins, Gatesmark, 2020.

## Prerequisites

You need a recent version of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
and [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html).
