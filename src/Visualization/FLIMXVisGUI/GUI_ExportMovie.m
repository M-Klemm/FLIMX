% @brief    A GUI for movie generation in FLIMXVis
%
% GUI_EXPORTMOVIE MATLAB code for GUI_ExportMovie.fig
%      GUI_EXPORTMOVIE, by itself, creates a new GUI_EXPORTMOVIE or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = GUI_EXPORTMOVIE returns the handle to a new GUI_EXPORTMOVIE or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      GUI_EXPORTMOVIE('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in GUI_EXPORTMOVIE.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      GUI_EXPORTMOVIE('Property','Value',...) creates a new GUI_EXPORTMOVIE or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before GUI_ExportMovie_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to GUI_ExportMovie_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
